 * @b libdwt is a cross-platform discrete wavelet transform library.
 *
 * @author David Barina <ibarina@fit.vutbr.cz>
 *
 * The library implements fast wavelet transform algorithm using lifting scheme.
 * Biorthogonal spline wavelets also known as Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelets
 * of order of 4 and 2 (with 4 and 2 vanishing moments) were used. The library is
 * implemented in C language, a demonstration application written in C++ and
 * employing OpenCV library is enclosed.
