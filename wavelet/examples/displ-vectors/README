NAME

displ-vectors

DESCRIPTION

The program for processing displacement vectors representing a distortion of an
optical system.

The input of processing program is matrix of vectors representing the distortion
of optical system. These vectors are equidistant in both dimensions. The program
is able to approximate these vectors using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).
In this case, the size of output matrix is equal to size of the input matrix.
Moreover, the program can interpolate missing vectors residing among input
vectors. In this second case, the size of output matrix is greater than the size
of intput matrix.

The input/output file in MATLAB ASCII format contains four columns: the
x-coordinate, the y-coordinate, the x-displacement, the y-displacement.

EXAMPLES

To approximate the distortion of optical system with 15 most important DWT
coefficients use command like:

./vectors input.mat output.mat 15 0

To interpolate this approximated matrix of vectors 4 times (two levels of
transform) in each dimension se:

./vectors input.mat output.mat 15 2

For most accurate approximation and maximum interpolation use:

./vectors input.mat output.mat -1 -1
