== UTIA ASVP platform ==

For cross-compilation for UTIA ASVP platform (formerly EdkDSP platform)
unpack files from asvpsdk-api-1.0.zip archive into ./api directory. This
archive can be downloaded from:

 http://sp.utia.cz/index.php?ids=projects/smecy&id=downloads

Now, you will need properly configured PicoBlaze and PetaLinux compiler for
library compilation. You can test it on example application in directory
./examples/simple with command:

make ARCH=asvp

== PC platform ==

Compile the example application like above but with command:

 make ARCH=x86_64

For example, a simple application showing libdwt API usage can be compiled
and started with:

 make -C examples/simple run

You can also compile the libdwt static library like follows:

 make ARCH=x86_64 BUILD=release -C src libdwt.a

Finally, do not forget to link your application also with -lm, -lrt, and
enable OpenMP with -fopenmp.

== Dependencies ==

* glibc/uClibc
* ASVP/EdkDSP SDK (optional on ASVP)
* Make
* GCC
** OpenMP support (optional)
* PicoBlaze C Compiler Toolchain V2 (optional on ASVP)
* Doxygen (optional)
* gnuplot (optional for examples)
* OpenEXR (optional)
